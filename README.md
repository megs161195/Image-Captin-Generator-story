## Motivation: 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/megs161195/Image-Captin-Generator-story/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Project Deliverables

1. Creating descriptive captions for each image in our images gallery. 
2. A “Search” option that takes user input ( for eg. ‘dog on desk’ ) and returns all images from the images gallery whose captions contain those particular words. 


**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/megs161195/Image-Captin-Generator-story/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
